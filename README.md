## Why?

This project was inspired by the [WhisperPair vulnerability](https://whisperpair.eu/) ([CVE-2025-36911](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-36911)), which highlighted privacy risks in Bluetooth devices.

Thousands of Bluetooth devices surround us at all times: phones, cars, TVs, headphones, hearing aids, delivery vehicles, and more. Bluehood demonstrates how simple it is to passively detect these devices and observe patterns in their presence.

With enough data, you could potentially:
- Understand what time someone typically walks their dog
- Detect when a visitor arrives at a house
- Identify patterns in daily routines based on device presence

This metadata can reveal surprisingly personal information without any active interaction with the devices.

**Bluehood is an educational tool to raise awareness about Bluetooth privacy.** It's a weekend project, but the implications are worth thinking about.

## What?

Bluehood is a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) scanner that:

- **Continuously scans** for nearby BLE devices
- **Identifies devices** by vendor (MAC address lookup) and BLE service UUIDs
- **Classifies devices** into categories (phones, audio, wearables, IoT, vehicles, etc.)
- **Tracks presence patterns** over time with hourly/daily heatmaps
- **Filters out noise** from randomized MAC addresses (privacy-rotated devices)
- **Provides a web dashboard** for monitoring and analysis

## Features

- Continuous Bluetooth LE scanning
- Web dashboard for real-time monitoring
- MAC address vendor lookup (local database + online API fallback)
- BLE service UUID fingerprinting for accurate device classification
- Device type detection (phones, audio, wearables, IoT, vehicles, etc.)
- 30-day presence timeline visualization
- Hourly and daily activity heatmaps
- Pattern analysis ("Weekdays, evenings 5PM-9PM")
- Mark devices as "Watched" for tracking personal devices
- Ignore unwanted devices
- Set friendly names for known devices
- Search by MAC, vendor, or name
- Date range search for historical queries
- Randomized MAC filtering (hidden from main view)

## How?

### Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dannymcc/bluehood.git
cd bluehood

# Start with Docker Compose
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f
```

The web dashboard will be available at **http://localhost:8080**

#### Docker Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Linux host with Bluetooth adapter
- BlueZ installed on the host (`apt install bluez` or `pacman -S bluez`)

> **Note**: Docker runs in privileged mode with host networking for Bluetooth access. This is required for BLE scanning.

#### Docker Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `BLUEHOOD_ADAPTER` | auto | Bluetooth adapter (e.g., `hci0`) |
| `BLUEHOOD_DATA_DIR` | `/data` | Database storage directory |

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Install system dependencies (Arch Linux)
sudo pacman -S bluez bluez-utils python-pip

# Install system dependencies (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt install bluez python3-pip

# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/dannymcc/bluehood.git
cd bluehood
pip install -e .
```

#### Bluetooth Permissions

Bluetooth scanning requires elevated privileges. Choose one:

1. **Run as root** (simplest):
   ```bash
   sudo bluehood
   ```

2. **Grant capabilities to Python**:
   ```bash
   sudo setcap 'cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw+eip' $(readlink -f $(which python))
   bluehood
   ```

3. **Use systemd service** (recommended for always-on):
   ```bash
   sudo cp bluehood.service /etc/systemd/system/
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable --now bluehood
   ```

## Usage

```bash
# Start with web dashboard (default port 8080)
bluehood

# Specify a different port
bluehood --port 9000

# Use a specific Bluetooth adapter
bluehood --adapter hci1

# List available adapters
bluehood --list-adapters

# Disable web dashboard (scanning only)
bluehood --no-web
```

## Web Dashboard

The dashboard provides:

- **Device list** with type icons, vendor, MAC, name, sightings, last seen
- **Device filters** by type (phones, audio, IoT, etc.) and watched status
- **Search** by MAC, vendor, or name
- **Date range search** to find devices seen in a specific time window
- **Device details** modal with:
  - BLE service fingerprints
  - Hourly/daily activity heatmaps
  - 30-day presence timeline
  - Signal strength (RSSI)
  - Pattern analysis

## Data Storage

Data is stored in `~/.local/share/bluehood/bluehood.db` (SQLite).

Override location with environment variables:
- `BLUEHOOD_DATA_DIR` - Directory for data files
- `BLUEHOOD_DB_PATH` - Direct path to database file

## How It Works

### Device Classification

Bluehood classifies devices using multiple signals (in priority order):

1. **BLE Service UUIDs** - Most accurate (Heart Rate = wearable, A2DP = audio, etc.)
2. **Device name patterns** - "iPhone", "Galaxy", "AirPods", etc.
3. **Vendor OUI lookup** - Apple, Samsung, Bose, etc.

### Randomized MACs

Modern devices randomize their MAC addresses for privacy. Bluehood:
- Detects randomized MACs (locally administered bit)
- Hides them from the main device list (not useful for tracking)
- Shows a count of hidden randomized devices

### Pattern Analysis

Bluehood analyzes sighting timestamps to detect patterns:

- **Time of day**: Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night
- **Day of week**: Weekdays, Weekends
- **Frequency**: Constant, Daily, Regular, Occasional, Rare

Example patterns: "Daily, evenings (5PM-9PM)", "Weekdays, morning (8AM-12PM)"

## Troubleshooting

### No devices found
- Ensure Bluetooth adapter is enabled: `bluetoothctl power on`
- Check adapter is detected: `bluehood --list-adapters`
- Run with sudo if permission denied

### Docker issues
- Ensure BlueZ is installed on the host (not just in container)
- Verify Bluetooth service is running: `systemctl status bluetooth`
